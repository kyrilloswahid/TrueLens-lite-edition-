# 🔍 Truelens - Deepfake Detection Platform 

## 🌟 Overview
Our project focuses on building a website that allows users to detect whether content—specifically images or audio—has been generated by artificial intelligence (AI) or created by humans. The system addresses the growing concern over distinguishing human-produced content from AI-generated content, which has become increasingly challenging with advancements in machine learning models.

By offering real-time, publicly accessible AI detection, the project aims to enhance transparency in content creation and help combat issues like misinformation, plagiarism, and improper use of AI.
